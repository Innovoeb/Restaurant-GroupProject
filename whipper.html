      <h4>About Us</h4>
        <p> We started with an idea that kids should have independent fun too. In
          our house, kids can socialize with their peers while eating delicious foods.
          While your kids are eating and socializing, parents can feel at ease knowing
          that their children are well supervised while you run errands. We provide excellent
          meal service given under the guise of a dive-bar restaurant atmosphere. We offer kid-sized
          finger foods and kiddy cocktails, with exceptional service.
        <p>
